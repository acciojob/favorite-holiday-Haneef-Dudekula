	<h1>Goa</h1>
	<br>
	<p>
		Goa is a state in western India with coastlines stretching along the Arabian Sea.
		Its long history as a Portuguese colony prior to 1961 is evident in its preserved
		17th-century churches and the areaâ€™s tropical spice plantations. Goa is also known
		for its beaches, ranging from popular stretches at Baga and Palolem to those
		in laid-back fishing villages such as Agonda
